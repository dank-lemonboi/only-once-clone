This is a full-stack clone of the website Only/Once, an e-commerce site who's layout and design i enjoyed more than most. While cloning this website I wanted to take the time to write the code out myself, meaning I wanted to limit my use of Third party libraries as much as possible. Doing so ended up taking a little longer than some of my peers who opted to use third party code to enhance their websites UX or functionality, but the struggle to write it on my own has led me to have a deeper understanding of JavaScript and the Document Object Model than I had before. I wrote the HTML CSS and JavaScript for the fade-in effects of the image carousel on the landing page, the animation effects that provide some enhanced user experience, the website product navigation functionality, and the infinite scroll below the email-form.

I use Redux to manage my state throughout the Application, and i used React as my Javascript framework. For payment processing I used Stripe.js, and I have an automated response system set up with Nodemailer and Twillio to give users a confirmation email and Text-message when they make a purchase. 

The server is set up with Node.js, using express as my framework. I'm using a PostgreSQL relational database, with Massive. 

Its been fun to develop, and helped me to learn and grow on my path of becoming a web-developer.

Admin view is still being developed, but the login portal is accessible by manually typing /admin into the URL.


Thanks for stopping by.
