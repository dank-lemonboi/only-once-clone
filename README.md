This was a little school project i did While at devMountain. It's my first attempt at cloning a website, and I decided to clone Only/Once because I enjoyed the UI and thought the layout was elegant but also doable.

Its been fun to develop, and helped me to learn and grow on my path of becoming a web-developer.


 I used:
    - React (Front-End)
    - Node.Js (Server)
    - Stripe (Payment Processing)
    - Nodemailer
    - Twilio


Admin view is accessible by manually typing /admin into the URL.


Thanks for stopping by.
